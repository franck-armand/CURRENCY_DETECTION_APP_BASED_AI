**THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN IMAGE BASED PAPER CURRENCY DETECTION SYSTEM**

---
Despite the fact that the world is moving at an incredible rate toward the cashless payment, paper currencies still play a major role in our daily transactions due to its convenience. However, being able to correctly identify banknotes remains an issue for individuals visually impaired or blind due to the variant shape and texture of paper currency. Different techniques have been used by researchers to successfully recognize banknotes. Among those, algorithms and systems such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Currency Recognition System For Visually Impaired (CRSFVI) applied to Jordanian and Egyptian currency respectively achieve 71% and 89% accuracy



a paper currency detection system (PCDS) is designed to detect the Chinese banknotes to assist visually impaired individuals. The system implementation is based on one of the most widely used Deep Learning (DL) algorithm for object detection; You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) as stated in the name only looks at the image once which makes it incredibly fast. The PCDS has been designed and implemented into an Android mobile application allowing the user to either take or load a picture from the smartphone which then goes through the detection system and returns the final result which is the detection performed on the provided input. The user receives the result of the detection through the mobileâ€™s speaker (auditory output). The experimental results show that the system identifies Chinese banknotes with an accuracy of 99.74%.
